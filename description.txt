- get_input_in_menu: the program is built on menu's that gets input from the user.
                      the main menu and the edit menu have the same structure so
                       we built a function called: get_input_in_menu.
                        this function arguments are tuples that contain the right
                         answers (in our case its 1,2,3 and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
                         but it can be any tuple) and the message to show the user.
                         the functions that uses get_input_in menu are main_menu and edit_menu.
- the main function: a loop that runs until the user wants to exit the program.
                     on every iteration it calls the main_menu function and gets
                     the valid response from it (because get_input_in_menu runs until it gets the
                     right response).
                     then, it checks which option the user chose by comparing it to the
                     main menu constants.
- edit_wav: a loop that runs until the user wants to go to the end menu.
            on every iteration, it calls the edit_menu function and gets the valid
            response from it.
            then, it checks which option the user chose by comparing it to the edit menu
            constants.
            every option has its own function to get a clean code.
- speed_down_data have an assisting function that is used by low_pass_average too.
    this function is pairs_average and it calculates the average of 2 pairs of values.
    it is used in low_pass_average when the index given is the first or the last in the list,
    because by the definition of low pass filter, when the pair is the first or the last,
    it is only needed to calculate the average of the nearest pair and not 3 pairs like with
    other indexes.

- get_edit_filename_and_data and get_compose_filename are 2 seperate functions that on paper,
        does the same thing, but each function have different tests on the while loop that
        runs until the tests pass. this tests couldn't be on another function.

- all the other assisting functions that weren't mentioned are outside there using function
    for clean code purposes.
